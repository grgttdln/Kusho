# Learn Mode Instruction Text Design

## Problem
Learn Mode lacks the instructional voice prompt text that Tutorial Mode displays at the top of the screen. Tutorial Mode shows dynamic per-step text (e.g., "Let's write a capital A!") with a pulsing animation during audio playback. Learn Mode should have the same feature.

## Approach
Reuse the existing TTS phrase infrastructure (`DeepgramTTSManager.getRandomPhrase()`) to generate instruction text per word, display it as a subtitle, and sync pulsing animation to TTS playback state.

## UI Layout (top to bottom)
1. **Title** — Activity name, 32sp bold black (existing)
2. **Activity type** — e.g., "Write the Word", 20sp medium purple (existing)
3. **Instruction text** — e.g., "Can you write the word DOG?", 16sp, gray→purple pulse (new)
4. Content area (existing)

## Instruction Text Per Activity Type
Phrases are generated by `DeepgramTTSManager.getRandomPhrase()`:
- **Write the Word**: "Can you write the word DOG?" / "Let's write the word DOG!" / etc.
- **Fill in the Blank**: "Fill in the missing letter to make the word DOG!" / etc.
- **Name the Picture**: "What is this picture? Trace and write its name!" / etc.

The phrase is generated once when the current word changes (stored in `remember` keyed on `currentStep`), and the same phrase is passed to the TTS `speak()` call so text and audio always match.

## Pulsing Animation
Copied from Tutorial Mode's pattern in `TutorialSessionScreen.kt:780-807`:
- **TTS playing**: Alpha pulses 1.0→0.4 on 600ms cycle (`infiniteRepeatable` + `tween`), color animates to `PurpleColor`, fontWeight SemiBold
- **TTS idle**: Static alpha 1.0, color `Color.Gray`, fontWeight Medium

## TTS State Tracking
Add `var isTtsPlaying by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }` to `LearnModeSessionScreen`.
- Set `true` before calling `speakRandomPhrase()`
- Set `false` in the `onComplete` callback of `speakRandomPhrase()`
- Both `DeepgramTTSManager` and `TextToSpeechManager` already support `onComplete`

## Files Changed
- `LearnModeSessionScreen.kt` — add instruction subtitle, isTtsPlaying state, pulsing animation

## Files Not Changed
- `DeepgramTTSManager.kt` — already has `getRandomPhrase()` and `onComplete`
- `TextToSpeechManager.kt` — already has `getRandomPhrase()` and `onComplete`
- `TutorialSessionScreen.kt` — no changes needed
